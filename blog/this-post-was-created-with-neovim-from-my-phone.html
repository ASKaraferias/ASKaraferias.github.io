  <p>This post was created from my phone. Don't think
that's a big deal? Well let me tell you why you're
mistaken.</p>
<p>I folllow a very specific process for editing this
blog. I write each post in <code>markdown</code> and I use
<a href="https://getpelican.com">pelican</a> to convert
everything to html and create a static blog which
I then push to my github page. </p>
<p>There are easier ways to create a blog but largely
the reason I enjoy maintaining this site is that I
have built everything - simple as it may be - from
the ground up. It's neat, it's simple, it's safe,
it's what the internet should be!</p>
<p>Furthermore, I could obviously create this post in
my phone using any old editor and then transfer
the file to my pc, build the blog and publish it,
but that is not really the correct way, because
you would have to choose between doing it manually
which, who has the time, or you have to rely to a
shady cloud service to sync your files between
your phone and your pc. Also you would miss the
opportunity to use your favorite editor - neovim.</p>
<p>No, the correct way is to create a github repo for
the staging area of your blog, meaning the directory
where you store all your markdown files that you
then use to create the html entries of the blog,
install termux in order to use your android phone
similarly to any other linux computer, install
neovim, git and gh on your phone, pull the staging
area repo to your phone, create your posts there
when you don't have access to your pc and finally
push your posts to main.</p>
<p>Personally I opted against building the blog in my
phone to ensure consistency of python packages
between builds. But it is definitely doable in
case you really want to publish your post directly
from your phone rather than waiting to get to your
pc.</p>
<p>Doing things the way I described means that one
can use the same editor and follow the same exact
process when editing their posts whether they have
access to their computer or not. Also if you are a
linux nerd you really enjoy doing things the linux
way every opportunity you get and if you are a
member of the cult of vim, using different editors
makes you feel disgusted, sad and guilty.</p>
