that's a big deal? Well let me tell you why you're

&lt;p&gt;I folllow a very specific process for editing this
blog. I write each post in &lt;code&gt;markdown&lt;/code&gt; and I use
&lt;a href="https://getpelican.com"&gt;pelican&lt;/a&gt; to convert
everything to html and create a static blog which
I then push to my github page. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are easier ways to create a blog but largely
the reason I enjoy maintaining this site is that I
have built everything - simple as it may be - from
the ground up. It's neat, it's simple, it's safe,
it's what the internet should be!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, I could obviously create this post in
my phone using any old editor and then transfer
the file to my pc, build the blog and publish it,
but that is not really the correct way, because
you would have to choose between doing it manually
which, who has the time, or you have to rely to a
shady cloud service to sync your files between
your phone and your pc. Also you would miss the
opportunity to use your favorite editor - neovim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, the correct way is to create a github repo for
the staging area of your blog, meaning the directory
where you store all your markdown files that you
then use to create the html entries of the blog,
install termux in order to use your android phone
similarly to any other linux computer, install
neovim, git and gh on your phone, pull the staging
area repo to your phone, create your posts there
when you don't have access to your pc and finally
push your posts to main.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally I opted against building the blog in my
phone to ensure consistency of python packages
between builds. But it is definitely doable in
case you really want to publish your post directly
from your phone rather than waiting to get to your
pc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doing things the way I described means that one
can use the same editor and follow the same exact
process when editing their posts whether they have
access to their computer or not. Also if you are a
linux nerd you really enjoy doing things the linux
way every opportunity you get and if you are a
member of the cult of vim, using different editors
makes you feel disgusted, sad and guilty.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Blog"></category></entry><entry><title>Special Kebab Recipe!</title><link href="https://karaferias.com/blog/special-kebab-recipe.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-12-23T00:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2024-12-23T00:00:00+02:00</updated><author><name>Apostolos Sotirios Karaferias</name></author><id>tag:karaferias.com,2024-12-23:/blog/special-kebab-recipe.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Ingredients:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;li&gt;1.5 tablespoons of oregano&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1.5 tablespoons of thyme&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Execution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The execution of this recipe is rather simple. Just put all of the ingredients
together in a large bowl and knead until the meat looks like putty. Kebabs taste
correct when they are kneaded much more extensively than standard patties. You
want them to have a really uniform look and feel when they are done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After you are finished masing the ingredients separate the meat into four to
five equal sized patties. If you want the tradidional look shape them like
cylinders rather than discs as you would for patties. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally just put the patties on a frying pan (with no added oil) and roast them
until they are crunchy on the outside but still soft on the inside. I usually
aim for medium well to well done (due to the pork) but keep in mind that it is
hard to tell because of the coloration from the tomato juice. So a bit of trial
and error is expected. As a good starting point I would suggest roasting for
about 15' total on the second or third highest level of your stovetop.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Recipes"></category></entry><entry><title>Atom and RSS feeds: The best way to keep up with the blog!</title><link href="https://karaferias.com/blog/atom-and-rss-feeds-the-best-way-to-keep-up-with-the-blog.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-03-12T02:38:00+02:00</published><updated>2024-03-12T02:38:00+02:00</updated><author><name>Apostolos Sotirios Karaferias</name></author><id>tag:karaferias.com,2024-03-12:/blog/atom-and-rss-feeds-the-best-way-to-keep-up-with-the-blog.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;In this post, I will try to briefly explain what Atom and RSS feeds are and why

they are in my opinion the best way to keep up with your favourite blogs and
news websites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Really Simple Syndication (RSS)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RSS is a standardized file format that contains text contents of online
websites, i.e. a file that a computer can read and contains contents of recent
posts of online blogs or other websites. A user can subscribe to an RSS feed
using a client program (like &lt;a href="https://github.com/spacecowboy/Feeder"&gt;Feeder&lt;/a&gt; on android, or &lt;a href="https://newsboat.org/"&gt;newsboat&lt;/a&gt; on the console) that
regularly (or whenever the user chooses) checks online for the new version of
the file, containing updates published on the website, and translates it into entries usually containing the article
titles and part of its contents into human-readable entries that one can usually
read directly inside their RSS reader. A lot of RSS readers (e.g. newsboat) offer
ways for the user to easily open the original article in their browser or to
view the entire article directly inside the reader (e.g. feeder).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Atom&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atom is a format that functions essentialy the same way as RSS but is more
modern and modular, enabling the use of its entries outside of the context of an
Atom feed reader. In the context of this article and a typical user they are
the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How to subscribe to my (or any other) feed&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most blogs and news websites provide RSS and Atom feeds. I make
those feeds available on the right hand side of my blog. You can subscribe to
one of them by copying the link and pasting it to your feed reader.
You can, for example, download Feeder from Google Play (or better yet, F-Droid), click on the three dots on the top
right and then 'Add Feed'. Then paste the link you copied from my blog, then hit
'Search' and 'Add Feed'. Simple as that! Now you can go do the same thing on all
of your favourite blogs and news sites and create a personalized feed that is
not relying on an algorithm that prioritizes certain things over others. Keep in
mind that a lot of websites offer multiple feeds for different article
categories.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Blog"></category></entry><entry><title>Hello World</title><link href="https://karaferias.com/blog/hello-world.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2024-03-11T18:56:00+02:00</published><updated>2024-03-11T18:56:00+02:00</updated><author><name>Apostolos Sotirios Karaferias</name></author><id>tag:karaferias.com,2024-03-11:/blog/hello-world.html</id><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hello World!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Blog"></category></entry></feed>
